## Econometrics & Statistics

### 1. [Distributionally Robust Instrumental Variables Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15634)
with Yongchan Kwon. Under Review (2024).

We propose a distributionally robust version of the calssical IV estimation method, motivated by common concerns in practice such as instrument validity.

### 2. [Towards Systematic and Optimal Modeling of Non-negative and Count Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qJS-sRlTLggwkjiYLQr0ihGnYKch6sUU/view?usp=sharing)
with Agostino Capponi. Working Paper (2024).

Although Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood is robust for modeling data with non-negative reponse variables, we show there can be better estimators depending on sparsity and heteroskedasticity.

### 3. [Semiparametric Estimation of Treatment Effects in Observational Studies with Heterogeneous Partial Interference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12420)
with Ruoxuan Xiong\*, Jizhou Liu, and Guido Imbens. Major Revision at _Journal of Business and Economic Statistics_ (2023).

We study augmented inverse propensity weighting (AIPW) estimators for causal effects under partial interference that accomodate heterogeneous interactions.

### 4. [Computationally Efficient Estimation of Large Probit Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09371)
with Patrick Ding, Guido Imbens, and Yinyu Ye. Major Revision at _Journal of Econometrics_ (2024).

We leverage methods in approximate Bayesian inference and non-linear optimization to significantly accelerate existing EM algorithms for probit models, enabling the analysis of consumer choice data with a large number of alternatives.

## Operations Research, Machine Learning & AI

### 5. [Inferring Dynamic Networks from Marginals with Iterative Proportional Fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18697)
with Serina Chang\*, Frederic Koehler\*, Jure Leskovec, and Johan Ugander. _41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)_  (2024).

We propose the ``biproportional Poisson'' model, which provides statistical foundations for a widely used message passing algorithm to infer network traffic from marginal information. 

### 6. [On Sinkhorn's Algorithm and Choice Modeling](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18pq78eIlByYdEl_ezIkA1AyF6wMpg6eg/view?usp=sharing)
with Alfred Galichon, Wenzhi Gao, and Johan Ugander. Accepted at _Operations Research_ (2025).

We connect matrix balancing and choice modeling, two topics that are almost 100 years old, and use the connections to obtain new insights on the convergence of Sinkhorn's algorithm.

### 7. [Optimal Diagonal Preconditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00809)
with Wenzhi Gao\*, Oliver Hinder, Yinyu Ye, and Zhengyuan Zhou. _Operations Research_ (2023).

We provide SDP and interior point methods for finding the optimal diagonal preconditioners of a matrix.

### 8. [A Unified Linear Speedup Analysis of Federated Averaging and Nesterov FedAvg](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05690)
with Kaixiang Lin\*, Zhaojian Li, Jiayu Zhou, and Zhengyuan Zhou. _Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research 78_: 1143-1200 (2023).

We establish the speedup of a class of popular federated learning algorithms in the number of participating local workers.
