## Operations Research & Machine Learning

### 1. [On Sinkhorn's Algorithm and Choice Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00260)
with Alfred Galichon, Wenzhi Gao, and Johan Ugander. _Operations Research_ (2025).

We connect matrix balancing and choice modeling, two topics that are almost 100 years old, and use the connections to obtain new insights on the convergence of Sinkhorn's algorithm.

### 2. [Optimal Diagonal Preconditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00809)
with Wenzhi Gao\*, Oliver Hinder, Yinyu Ye, and Zhengyuan Zhou. _Operations Research_ (2025).

We provide SDP and interior point methods for finding the optimal diagonal preconditioners of a matrix.

### 3. [Structured Lasso for convex nonparametric least squares: An application to Swedish electricity distribution networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01911)
with Zhiqiang Liao. Major Revision at _European Journal of Operational Research_  (2025).

We propose a structured Lasso method for variable selection in convex nonparametric regression problems. 

### 4. [Inferring Dynamic Networks from Marginals with Iterative Proportional Fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18697)
with Serina Chang\*, Frederic Koehler\*, Jure Leskovec, and Johan Ugander. _41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)_  (2024).

We propose the ``biproportional Poisson'' model, which provides statistical foundations for a widely used message passing algorithm to infer network traffic from marginal information. 

## Econometrics & Statistics

### 1. [Handling Sparse Non-negative Data in Finance](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5219954)
with Agostino Capponi. Under Review (2025).

Although Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood is commonly recommended for modeling data in finance and economics with non-negative dependent variables, there can be better estimators depending on the _sparsity_ and _heteroskedasticity_ of data. We propose a systematic framework that informs empirical researchers on such choices.

### 2. [Distributionally Robust Instrumental Variables Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15634)
with Yongchan Kwon. Under Review (2024).

We propose a distributionally robust version of the calssical IV estimation method for inferring causal effects, motivated by common concerns in practice such as instrument validity.

### 3. [Computationally Efficient Estimation of Large Probit Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09371)
with Patrick Ding, Guido Imbens, and Yinyu Ye. Major Revision at _Journal of Econometrics_ (2024).

We leverage methods in approximate Bayesian inference and non-linear optimization to significantly accelerate existing EM algorithms for probit models, enabling the analysis of consumer choice data with a large number of alternatives.

### 4. [Semiparametric Estimation of Treatment Effects in Observational Studies with Heterogeneous Partial Interference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12420)
with Ruoxuan Xiong\*, Jizhou Liu, and Guido Imbens. Major Revision at _Journal of Business and Economic Statistics_ (2023).

We study augmented inverse propensity weighting (AIPW) estimators for causal effects under partial interference that accomodate heterogeneous interactions among units.
