I am a postdoctoral research scientist at the [Data Science Institute at Columbia University](https://datascience.columbia.edu/) mentored by [Agostino Capponi](https://www.columbia.edu/~ac3827/) and [Simon Lee](https://econ.columbia.edu/econpeople/sokbae-simon-lee/).

My research interests are at the intersection of econometrics, operations research, and machine learning, with a focus on causal inference, optimization, choice modeling, and networks. I leverage novel connections between these topics to investigate foundational and policy-relevant questions that arise in domains such as online marketplaces, transportation networks, and the legal and justice system. 

I received my PhD in Economics from Stanford University in 2024, advised by [Guido Imbens](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/guido-w-imbens) and [Yinyu Ye](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/). I was also mentored by [Alfred Galichon](https://alfredgalichon.com/), [Han Hong](https://profiles.stanford.edu/han-hong), and [Johan Ugander](https://web.stanford.edu/~jugander/).

I am on the 2024-2025 job market.
