I am a postdoctoral research scientist at the [Columbia University Data Science Institute](https://datascience.columbia.edu/) mentored by [Agostino Capponi](https://www.columbia.edu/~ac3827/) and [Simon Lee](https://econ.columbia.edu/econpeople/sokbae-simon-lee/).

I recently received my PhD in January 2024 from the Department of Economics at Stanford University, advised by [Professor Guido Imbens](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/guido-w-imbens). I was also mentored by [Professor Alfred Galichon](https://alfredgalichon.com/), [Professor Han Hong](https://profiles.stanford.edu/han-hong), [Professor Johan Ugander](https://web.stanford.edu/~jugander/), and [Professor  Yinyu Ye](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/).

My research interests include econometrics, operations research, causal inference, optimization, data science, and particularly the interactions between them in theoretical, empirical, and policy questions.

I am on the 2024-2025 job market.
