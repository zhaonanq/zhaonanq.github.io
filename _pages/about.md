I recently received my PhD in January 2024 from the Department of Economics at Stanford University, where my advisor was [Professor Guido Imbens](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/guido-w-imbens). I was also mentored by [Professor Alfred Galichon](https://alfredgalichon.com/), [Professor Han Hong](https://profiles.stanford.edu/han-hong), [Professor Johan Ugander](https://web.stanford.edu/~jugander/), and [Professor  Yinyu Ye](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/).

My research interests include econometrics, operations research, causal inference, optimization, data science, and particularly the interactions between them in theoretical, empirical, and policy questions.

[Here is my CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1paYToHFJQDhySTRd_p88Ycaq9IuEXX7M/view). I will be on the 2024-2025 job market.
